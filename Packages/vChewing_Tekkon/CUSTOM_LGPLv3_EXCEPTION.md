# Custom Exception to LGPLv3 for Swift Package

This Swift package is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPLv3) with the following additional permission:

### Additional Permission under LGPLv3 Section 7

Notwithstanding any other provision of the LGPLv3, you have permission to link or combine this Swift package ("Package") with other modules to produce an executable, regardless of the code signing requirements imposed by Apple Inc. Specifically, if you use this Package in an Xcode project, you are not required to designate a paid Apple Developer ID to sign the resulting dynamic library when building and distributing the executable.

You are still required to comply with all other terms of the LGPLv3 in all respects for all of the code used other than the Package. If you modify this Package, you may extend this exception to your version of the Package, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

This Additional Permission applies only to the code released with this Package under LGPLv3 and does not extend to any other code or libraries it interacts with.

### How to Apply This Exception

To apply this exception, you must include a copy of this document and ensure that it is referenced in your project's licensing documentation. This ensures that users of your Swift package and any derivative works are aware of the additional permission granted by this exception.

### Example Usage

```
